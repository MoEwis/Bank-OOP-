<h1> BANK OOP </h1>
This project aims to simulate a bank account management system using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It provides several functions such as creating new bank accounts, displaying all existing accounts, searching for a specific account by account number, and allowing deposits and withdrawals from accounts.
